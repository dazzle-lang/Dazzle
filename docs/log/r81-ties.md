# r81: ties, `kills` clauses and compiler-placed memory

The language change is spec §6.7 and §14.6, decided as D-0091; the plan, in order, is
T-0107. How it came about: the regions prototype (T-0104, T-0105, on the branch
`t-0104-regions-prototype`) tried to choose allocators without a checker, and each stage's
safety rested on rules a test had found. The user's own "ties" idea supplied the checker, and
D-0091 was decided on 2026-10-27.

## 2a: the syntax (2026-10-27)

Parsed and kept, with no meaning yet: nothing past the parser reads a clause.

- **`kills` is a keyword** (`dz_lex`), and `@`, already a token nothing used, starts a tie.
- **The tree** (`dz_ast`): a `TiePath` is a root (a parameter or `self`) and steps — `.field`,
  `[*]`, `@tie`. `FnDecl` gained `ret_tie` (`-> ^T in self@items`) and `kills`; `Param` and
  `Field` gained `tie`; a function type gained optional parameter names and its own `kills`.
  The dump prints them only when present, so no earlier snapshot changed.
- **The parser** (`dz_parse`): a clause sits after the return type, a reference's `in`
  after its type and before a default, a field's `in @name` after its type. A path that
  breaks off is one `DZ0218` and is kept as far as it got: `xs[1]` drops the index and keeps
  `[*]`, and `in items` reads as `in @items`, so the default, the body and everything after
  still parse (invariants 1 and 6).
- **One grammar point settled here:** in a function type, a comma after a bare path begins
  the next parameter (`fn each(f: fn(xs: &mut List<i32>) kills xs@items, n: i32)`), so a
  list of paths there is parenthesised. A declaration's list never needs to be, and a
  parenthesised one is accepted anywhere; the formatter writes the parentheses only where
  they are needed.
- **The formatter** (`dz_fmt`) writes all of it through the dump's own spellings, so a clause
  survives exactly; `tests/fmt/ties.dz` shows the layout it settles on.
- **Hygiene** (`dz_macro`): a tie path's root is renamed with the parameter it names, through
  a new `tie_root` hook, so a clause a macro writes still names its own parameter. A function
  type's clause is not walked: its parameter names are not binders.

- **The editor**: `kills` is coloured as a keyword by the VS Code grammar and offered by
  completion (`dz_lsp`'s `KEYWORDS`), the two places a new keyword was once missed.
- **Unrelated, found on the way:** `dz_resolve`'s workspace snapshots counted std's files
  before the prototype branch added three (`scope_arena`, `scope_pool`, `scope_shared`);
  only those counts changed.

Tests: `tests/parse/ties.dz` (every form), four mistakes in `tests/parse/errors.dz`,
`tests/fmt/ties.dz`, `kills` in `tests/lex/keywords.dz`, and two targeted parser tests (the
comma rule, and `kills` no longer being a name). `dz explain DZ0218` has its wrong and right
programs.
